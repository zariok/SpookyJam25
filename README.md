##  About
Grab all collectibles and STOMP all gnomes to finish the level!

Prior to starting this project, I had never opened Godot or any game creating software.  Everything contained here is based on learning what it would take to put together a game using Godot and GDScript.  I followed some tutorials on YT as well as searching the web for various concepts.
